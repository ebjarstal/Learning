# Notes from lecture 2

## Vectors and functions

Functions follow the properties of vectors: functions are vectors

## Norms

You can easily calculate norm of a vector, but also the norm of a function (e.g L2 norm)

## Inner product

Aka scalar product / dot product

Notation <u,v>

Obvious property: symmetry

We also got inner product for functions: how well do they line up ?

Small inner product: dont line up very well
